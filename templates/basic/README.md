# Basic

Basic Angular app template.

## Development server

```bash
npm start
```

It will navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npm run generate component <component-name>` to generate a new component. You can also use `npm run generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

If you have installed [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally with `npm install -g @angular/cli`,
you can also use the command `ng generate` directly.

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Lint code

Run `npm run lint`
